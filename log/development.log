Warriors Fan Has Kind Words For LeBron After The Game Kendrick Perkins on Dellavedova: \"Every time I walk in there, he's the first guy there. He done, shot and lifted and ate breakfast and shot again and all types of s--- before I got there.\" Steve Kerr's look of disbelief matched by a fan [Trey Kerby] At practices in Oakland, I saw Draymond Green take about 100 threes and make maybe 25 of them. LeBron: \"I watched Chopped last night and then Teen Titans after that at 2:30 in the morning.\" [CBSSports] Amico- Tristan Thompson on the theory that Cavs defending so hard in NBA Finals that they might wear down: \"I'm 24 years old.\" [Post Game Thread] The Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Golden State Warriors 96-91 to take a 2-1 series lead. LeBron James makes finals record of most points ever scored in the first 3 games of the finals Delly oops it to Lebron Game 3 scored a 13.7 overnight rating, highest ever for a Game 3 on ABC [Prada] The Cavaliers are exposing the big problem with the Warriors' offense Draymond Green: \"Gave me the confidence?

Excuse me, Reddit. Do you think you could identify this tree for me? What phone numbers can you still remember by heart? How much would you weigh if you could hypothetically survive a visit to the very center of the earth?
